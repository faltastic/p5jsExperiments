The opposition is a group of people who don't agree with an opinion, so they go out to oppose it, from whatever side. The opposition isn't necessarily opposition to El-Sisi or opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood—no, opposition covers anything that opposes.
The word opposition means that I oppose something—I oppose something done in the State. I must, as an Egyptian citizen, oppose anything I don't like. It's my right! There could be a peaceful way for us to fix the law together.
Like maybe the protest law. You put a law in place for me that doesn't work for me, so now I have to oppose the law. How will I oppose it? I'll oppose in a revolutionary way, like a march, to let the media and people around know that I oppose that law. There is only one way to let them know, and that's our revolutionary way. Like, it's impossible for me to go to the precinct and say, "I don't like the law."
Obviously, opposition has spread a lot now. Opposition shows up for anything that happens in this country. Anything that happens, the opposition must show up for it. And they're the ones taking this country straight to hell in a handbasket.
There's no way that there's a regime in the world that has everyone around it in one hundred percent support of it. There has to be difference in order for something creative to happen—in order for there to be social development. If there's really a complete authority that exists, there have to be people who diverge from it. There has to be a good percentage, and they have to have a space for difference and a space for expressing their difference in a very clear way, so that in the end they can achieve something good.
