The word get out is the only word that was spoken and achieved in the January 25th Revolution.
Get out means leave! It means go away!
For me, the word get out is the ultimate demand. I mean that when we've already demanded one-two-three and they haven't been implemented, it's the final demand. "Get out, we don't want you, once and for all." After get out, there are no more demands.
Sometimes get out is written in different languages, so they'll understand.
We said get out to the wrong person. We said it to Hosni Mubarak, but we should have said it to the entire military regime.
Get out is destruction.
I can say that they could've done it another way, but it wasn't possible to do it any other way. He had to go, but he could've gone in a better way. It's more than enough for him to sit in his jail cell or sit in a cage in the courtroom. He looks like a president; he is a president. Like, he's not like Morsi, never… It's impossible for him to be like Morsi. It's impossible that Hosni be like Morsi. For sure, for sure, Hosni is a prince.
Get out is spelled with four letters [in Arabic]. If we add one letter, it makes the phrase: "I see a solution." It's an addition. Each time you add something small, then another little thing, then another, it will one day add up to something huge. If everyone saw a solution—a little idea, then another and another—it would become something big.
