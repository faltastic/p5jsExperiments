We are some of the youth of Tahrir Square. We are the ones who protected Tahrir Square. We are the ones who protected the revolution.
Guards of the Square.
We were all one hand in the Square—guards of the revolution.
It was such a nice thing… a good thing that we… we the people, who were sitting-in… every person who left home to sit-in and demand their rights… that we protected each other.
We protected the protesters and those who where sitting-in in the Square from thugs. They slept at night in the tents, and we protected the tents from outside—against thugs, felool, and the Muslim Brothers when they came at us.
We closed the gates; we got barbed wire from the Army's supply to close the gates. Then, we'd stay up all night.
We searched whoever came in, asked them where they were going, and checked their IDs.
People came. Thugs came at us from Mohamed Mahmoud Street and from Boulaq Abu Illa. Thugs came at us from Abdeen. Thugs came at us from Bustan Mall with comrades and guns.
They came at us. They wanted to clear the sit-ins and tear down the tents. They set the tents on fire and stuff like that.
We kept on going, securing and guarding the Square. We kept protecting Tahrir Square until, thank God, the Lord gave us what we had asked for.
