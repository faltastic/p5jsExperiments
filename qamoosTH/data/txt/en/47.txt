Go out, before the revolution, was just a word: “Hey you, go out!” — “Come on, let’s go out.” — “Come, take this out.” No one ever imagined that a phrase like 'go out' could play such a big role in the revolution. 
People said the phrase, “Go out,” on January 25th, to make people feel like coming out to the January 25th Revolution. To make them go to Tahrir Square. 
Everybody’s gotta go out, say their opinion, and express what’s inside them.
It reminds me, too, of Alexandria when we were walking by the sea. Everyone was walking behind us, towards the Citadel. They were saying to people in their houses, “Go out! Go out! Go out! Go out!” And people came out, or they didn’t come out. You were saying it to say, “Here we are! Do you want to go out? Go out!”
The phrase, “Oh Egyptian, go out! Oh Egyptian, go out!” makes me want to puke. Motherfuckers! Like, we’re not cheering on Ahly soccer. I feel like, when people are happy like that, I don’t understand it. I don’t like communities!
It means don’t be afraid, go out and nobody will slit your throat. Go out to the demonstration, go out!
Of course, people were afraid. They were afraid of coming out. “How can I go out and you basically...” You see, people weren’t convinced yet that we were right. When we started to explain our position to them, when it started to be clear to them that we were right, people started to go out with us.
All of the demonstrations, in most of the governorates, started out with a small number: maybe not more than 25 or 30 people. They started moving in the streets. They would chant, “Go out! Go out! Go out!” They got to be a significant number, and that number is pretty much what made the revolution.
