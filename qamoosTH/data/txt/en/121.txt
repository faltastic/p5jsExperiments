VOICE 
When a group of people goes out to say something specific, it shouldn’t be spoken with a hand or with a stone, with gunfire or with any kind of destruction. It should be spoken with the voice.
I imagine what's meant by voice isn’t the sound, but your opinion. Your opinion spoken in a loud voice, one that's listened to—people pay attention to it.
The most important thing is the citizen’s voice.
The voice is always heard. I mean, so long as someone is raiseing their voice, the country will stay alive, and no can silence the people—ever.
I don't know. Some time ago I felt that whatever we voiced, it was never heard. 
The voice belongs to the demonstration. As long as there's a large number, the voice will get to where it's going. And no one can restrain that voice, as long as what they’re saying is right. 
The voices of the youth when they were in the Square, chanting: "Raise, raise, raise your voice; whoever chants will not die."
"A woman's voice is not a sin." They used to say that a lot in the demonstrations.
After the revolution, the voice got to have a value. Before the revolution, even when we in civil society would raise an issue, organize a conference and meet with people, that would be the end of it. No one would bring up the subject again. But now when you say that something is an issue, you speak, you make groups on Facebook, you do other things—your voice is heard.
The most important thing is the citizen’s voice.
Now in the conditions we live in, there is no voice at all. This way or that, my voice has no value. Whoever speaks is trampled down. Now we find informants at the university with us, they find out who's who and what they're doing. We went back to the Mubarak era—or no, in the Mubarak era one could sneak around and talk.
It's boredom and despair. That's what extinguishes the voice. Not gunfire or imprisonment. Boredom and despair.
