STRIKE
I see that a strike is a way for us to have our voice reach the regime faster: faster than peaceful demonstrations, faster than all of that. A strike is something that affects the country. We stop one thing or another in the country, we start putting pressure, escalating it, and then we start to reach the next stages. It’s really one of the solutions. You have to sacrifice quite a lot to have a strike. A strike means you paralyze the state. And it’s revolution: as if you have cut down a tree in order to plant in its place a new, good tree, with good roots.
A strike isn’t always a good idea. Sometimes it’s necessary, like if people are demanding rights: it’s a weapon of restraint, something like that. And sometimes it’s honestly aggravation from the people: it’s too much. Clashes, gunfire, strikes—all of that is the fault of the absence of the state, the law, and the state’s endowment, and the fact that no one is afraid of the police. Everyone has completely become their own president, or everyone has made their own state for themselves.
This way or that, there won’t be a strike. I mean, a strike is when we are all agreed on one thing. Like for instance, when the people working for the tram took a stand... that doesn’t happen much. The people working for the tram all got together in one place, and the whole country stood still, but now we are fractured. Now one prefers to stay silent, that’s better now.
