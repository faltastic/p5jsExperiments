An idea came up in Egypt for an ambulance that was an airplane—an airplane that transports the injured and stuff, in case there is traffic on the way and the ambulance can't get through. It's used to save people who're dying and stuff.
We never saw an air ambulance for anyone except Hosni Mubarak.
It goes out for important people. We never saw it in our clashes or in our sit-ins.
During the Mohamed Mahmoud clashes, the air ambulance was embodied by the youth's motorcycles. They would move the demonstrators right away.
We were all standing and making a human wall so that the air ambulance—the motorcycles—could pass through. 
The motorcycle would go pick up a protester from the Square, take him to the hospital in the Square, and then go back and get another one.
