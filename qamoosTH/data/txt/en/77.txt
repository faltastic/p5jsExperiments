Before the revolution, the only way we knew how to use an onion was in preparing food. But during the eighteen days, we discovered that the onion had great value.
The youth went on Facebook and heard about the Tunisian Revolution—it was before the Egyptian Revolution. The Tunisian youth told us, "When you're hit with tear gas, you should sniff an onion." So when we were assaulted with tear gas, people in the streets would get onions from any passing cart. 
Until there was something else really nice: people in their houses, women who wanted to participate… That's another part of women's role. Obviously, they couldn't come out in the gas, so they would open the window of the balcony and throw onions out of it. The onions would get passed around, until the youth learned that the onion was an essential thing. You would bring it with you in your bag just in case, God forbid. If there was tear gas or something, I'd get an onion and smell it.
The Egyptian people helped the people in the Square, even if they opposed them. They helped them when they were hit with gas. The would throw onions to them, to help them. In that way, you join the people in the revolution; even if you're staying at home, you're participating.
