I didn't know the word coalition before the revolution.
Maybe youth who have political leanings knew the word, but in general most of them didn't know it before. 
I never heard the word until after the revolution.
We got together after the neighborhood watch groups, after the Friday of Rage, and we said, "We want to do something together." — Then we said, "What will it be? What are we gonna do?" — Someone said, "We're a coalition because there are different people among us." So, a coalition is a group of different people who agree on an idea, or have a common interest.
It's a group of people who get together under a specific name. They get together under a banner that brings them together, and they call what they move with a coalition. They go out to march; they form a political party; they make a movement. The Coalition of Revolutionary Youth, the Governors' Coalition… a coalition by whatever name.
Every two guys who got together were a coalition.
Every five or six guys sitting at the coffeeshop said, "Right, ok, so we're gonna make a coalition together." It got to be boring. Every hour, every minute, in everything, there's a coalition. Even in a game of backgammon. We coalesce today, we diverge tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, we coalesce again.
Once the coalition was formed, it got much bigger than it needed to be. It was ruined by getting so big, because its course and orientation were no longer clear. Because there was more than one group in the coalition that did something that not everyone agreed to.
The youth don't know what a coalition is, so they couldn't realize their revolution. Maybe the reason this revolution failed is that it didn't have an administrative process—people to manage the revolution, its course, and its ideas. 
We've reached a point at which no one will suppress us again. No one will try to pressure us again. So I don't think we need a coalition, thank God.
