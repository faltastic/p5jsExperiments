Bread is a Pharaonic Egyptian word meaning life.
Bread was one of the first demands of the revolution. Actually, even before the January 25th Revolution, we demanded it. We demanded bread, freedom, and social justice. Those were our basic demands.
As we saw it, bread was the least thing a citizen could ask for. It's the most basic thing for a human: to eat, to have a normal standard of living.
For me, bread means that a person lives a life with dignity. 
From my perspective, people here aren't revolting for freedom or dignity. They're revolting because they're hungry.
Up till now, it hasn't been achieved. The poor aren't equal to the rich. The rich take; they eat and drink what they want. If the poor find something to eat, they eat and go to sleep; if they don't, they go hungry.
The next revolution, if it happens, will be for bread. It will be a mess; it will be a hunger revolution. The hungry people, who are literally starving, who are so poor they can't get a loaf a bread—the destitute—will say, "That's it, we've had enough. We're fed up with everything. We need to eat." They'll kill each other; they'll kill the Army; they'll kill the government; they'll kill the rich. They'll kill everything they see. Do you know how locusts strip the land? They'll be like that. They'll be just like locusts.
