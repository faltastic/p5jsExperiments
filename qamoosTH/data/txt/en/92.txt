Egypt is prosperous, and because of that we need a president to come and rule it well. We don't want someone who wants us to let him rule for himself like a thugâ€¦ to rule us with thuggery. 
Rule is the President of the Republic. The President says to the Egyptian people, "Don't do that!" They listen and they don't do it. And if someone goes along anyway and does what he said not to do, where will they end up? They'll end up in jail or prison.
Rule means that I rule the country. I rule with justice and equality between the rich and the poor. For example, if someone hit someone else, the other doesn't get up and hit them back. They say, "God forgive you." They don't hit them the same way they were hit. That's the rule that I'd like to do.
People say, "Where is the one who'll rule us?" despite the fact that each person should rule themselves. Everyone is supposed to respect the rules that are put on all of us. It's the rules that are put on people that rule people. 
The people are the ones who make the word 'rule.' It's you who makes the word 'rule,' not the regime.
