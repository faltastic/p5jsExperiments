STONE
I think the use of stone changed in an tremendous way from before the revolution to after. Before the revolution, their use was limited to building, but after the revolution they had other uses. Now we don't build a lot; we break stones, even those used for building, to use them in protests.
Stones are flat out a protesters's weapon, specifically peaceful protesters who are attacked by security forces. It's the first thing in front on them, the nearest thing… like, the easiest thing for them.
There was no day where there were clashes and there weren't stones. Even when there weren't stones, people would go to the sidewalk and break it to take a stone, and then throw it at Central Security.
Look, I went out to a lot of clashes and a lot of protests, but I never thought of throwing a stone at anyone, even if it was someone who harmed me, because I think it's not a peaceful means. Honestly, anyone who does that is not a thug, but throwing a stone is the simplest weapon.
If they started throwing stones right away, they're not peaceful protesters, and I wouldn't call them protesters to begin with. They're called thugs if they started with an attack.
I used to be really bothered when I'd find a little kid coming to throw a stone at the police, because they might respond to the kid and kill him, even if he doesn't know anything, even if he doesn't know why we're going out to begin with… you know? At the same time, I'd sometimes be with him, when I felt that was it, we couldn't do anything but throw stones at them.
It's a really sad thing when people defend themselves with stones… not sad as much as it's the means of the weak to defend themselves. They can't find anything else to defend themselves with, or to express themselves, so they're forced to get stones and throw them. Anyone who uses weak means of defending themselves—a stone—doesn't have anything else to do.
