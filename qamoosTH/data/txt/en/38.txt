A few infiltrators is a song I love. Do you know it? "Once I went to stand with…" It's a song, man! It came out right after the revolution. "Once I went to stand with a few infiltrators; they never felt deceived or cheated." The guy who sings it is called Yasser Elmanawahly.
A few infiltrators is the third hand of the invisible man. The hunter, as they say, who hunts something no one knows how to find. It's kind of like Batman of the night. That's a few infiltrators.
It was a term launched during the January 25th protests in the first revolution. It was used to describe the youth who got themselves together to make the country better. They called them a few infiltrators because they thought they were infiltrators who wanted to break and destroy things, and stop the country from being any good.
Actually, it was always used to describe protests in Hosni Mubarak's era. During the whole thirty years, every time a protest happened in the country, someone would come out against it: "Those are a few infiltrators in the country."
It's been used since Hosni Mubarak up till Morsi, who also used it. SCAF used it, and it's still being used today.
I think Abdel Nasser used it for the first time, or something like that.
The term was launched before the revolution, specifically in 2007, to describe the April 6th youth. The National Democratic Party started using it to describe them. The April 6th youth started holding conferences parallel to the NDP's conferences. They were called Conferences of a Few Infiltrators.
After the revolution, during the eighteen days, a few infiltrators started to circulate in public. The regime's men would appear on TV saying that the people in the Square were a few infiltrators. The media would say, "Those are a few infiltrators. Don't go out." The public believed what the media said, and they'd say, "Those are a few infiltrators."
The same meaning stuck for three years. You'd find a huge number of youth in the Square, and someone passing by would say, "You're a few infiltrators. You're infiltrators from abroad." They'd say the same thing about Arbaeen Square in Suez: "You're a few infiltrators."
By the way, a long time ago, at the beginning, like in the days of Mubarak, I used to believe in the concept of a few infiltrators. But after that, when I started following things more and stuff, I found out that no, there's like no such thing as a few infiltrators.
A few infiltrators isn't a guy dressed all in black and walking around as a stranger. No, a few infiltrators has developed now; I mean, I see them every day, but I can't call them a few infiltrators.
A few infiltrators: the police. They turn the government against the people, and the people against the government. They've got everything in their hands. They're basically the ruler's goons.
It's the phrase that any failing ruler always uses when they don't know how to deal with their opposition, or they don't really know how to achieve their demands… that kind of thing. So they say they're a few infiltrators. It's not just in Egypt. I mean, in every country that has dictatorial rulers who don't know how to rule, they always see their opposition as a few infiltrators.
I don't know why they call them infiltrators.
It's a word without any meaning. At first, the revolutionaries were a few infiltrators. Then it was the Brotherhood: a few infiltrators. People now say, "I'm neither this nor that." A few infiltrators… anyone who opposes the mainstream in this country is called a few infiltrators.
Mostly, the few infiltrators have the right opinion. Mostly, their opinion turns out to be right, and the majority is wrong. Let's have a look for example at every election in the whole world. You always find that the most capable person doesn't win.
I think this word will keep on being used for three or four more years.
Except right now, the few infiltrators are called 'the fifth column' or 'traitors and agents.'
