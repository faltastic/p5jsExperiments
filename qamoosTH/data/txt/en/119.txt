VINEGAR
Onions and vinegar: before the revolution, I knew they were for salad.
I was in Cairo on the Day of Rage; I was trapped there with my colleagues. We were in Downtown, on 26th July Street, and we were watching out the hotel window. But when it was time to leave the hotel for the train station, there were still demonstrations going on. In order to get out, we had to cross a number of streets. At the time, the Army had come out already… the amount of tear gas! I have حساسية فضاعت allergies, so I ضاعت خالص was ruined. I started tearing up. They told us, "Vinegar helps with tear gas." That's the first time I heard that. So my colleagues and I ran to the supermarket and bought a bottle of vinegar. We soaked our tissues and put them over our faces like this. بقينا بقى المانديل بتاعتنا نكممها كده ونفعتنا، نفعتنا يعني.
After the revolution, onions and vinegar had a lot of uses. Like, after we inhaled gas we'd put vinegar so we didn't cry, and we sniffed onions for the same reason.
We got the idea for vinegar from Tunisia. We were following the Tunisian Revolution; we knew what they were doing over there. Of course, everything was written on the internet and stuff like that, so we found out that vinegar does such-and-such… and Pepsi. Yeah, Pepsi for our eyes.
It was really new information. It was the first time I heard that vinegar counteracted… Egyptians say that Pepsi and vinegar and that stuff… they knew that in Tunisia they were using those things. 
The whole vinegar thing spread during Mohamed Mahmoud, at the time when they were grabbing tear gas bombs. The doctors… or generally speaking, the pharmacists that were working with us… they found that it allows the breath… generally speaking, the breath… vinegar was what  بيخليه صافي شوية helped relieve it.
But we didn't cook vinegar, we cooked beer yeast… it came out, like, white.
I saw them treating with vinegar; yeah, I learned that… I learned that from the demonstrations.
