Injustice is, like, a very intellectual word, so it's funny that we've talked about it so much: "That's pretty much an injustice," — "That's unjust and there's no way!" — and, "These people have been done injustice. They were born into injustice, lived and died injustice." What does that mean?! I mean, what exactly does that mean?!
Injustice is a word used to describe anything with torture, with coercion, with poverty, with something not in its place. Something without equality or justice…
Different treatment. That's injustice. 
I mean, injustice is well known. There's a verse in a poem that says, "Injustice is a trait of the self; if you find one who holds back, there must be a reason he is not unjust." I think the poet was Al-Mutanabbi. Meaning whoever isn't unjust isn't able to be unjust… that's what the poet wants to say. It's human nature. If a human can practice injustice, they will.
The revolution is against injustice… the revolution rose up against injustice. There were many kinds of injustice, and they remain. Injustice remains, and the revolution has become a burden on the community and an injustice to society. But that's the nature of revolution.
There's an expression that says, "Humans seek justice unjustly, and deny their own injustices." They demand justice when they are weak, and deny it when they are strong. 
People will suffer injustice as long as humans are on earth. There will be injustice, but in different degrees. There is no absolute justice. Absolute justice is God!
