Before the revolution, people didn't know a lot about them. They just knew of legal papers, lawyers…
Before the revolution, all pamphlets just targeted Palestine, and the National Democratic Party were the ones who made them. It was a security tactic in the past; they would reveal themselves to each other using these pamphlets.
From 2008 to 2011, pamphlets would be distributed that called for revolution, that called for marches and protests, that called for things until something happened, like an حد حصل حاجة مثلا اتخطف كده  abduction.
After the revolution, they weren't necessary because I had graffiti as my address. That was my pamphlet, and I used it to express myself. Because there's technology—Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. That's what cancelled out pamphlets.
For these three years, we made pamphlets just as a piece of paper to distribute to people. We'd just write some words on the paper to express ourselves. We'd write all of the goals and demands of our revolution, and talk about the rights of the martyrs that still haven't come. We'd distribute them to people in the Metro and that sort of thing.
We'd make people aware of an issue: a detainee, a prisoner, a martyr. We'd make them aware of when a protest would happen, why we were sitting in, what our demands were. These were called pamphlets, which are papers on which we write our demands.
Whoever was holding them would be charged with overthrowing the regime, incitement, blocking traffic, and storming Tahrir Square. They didn't just charge you with pamphlets. Like our colleagues who were taken from the Opera House, who were merely passing out scarves with 'The revolution continues' written on them. They were charged with storming Tahrir Square and vandalism to public institutions.
